The source code for this application is in [`main.py`](main.py). For instructions how to run it, please see [here](https://github.com/1mh/pyqt-examples#running-the-examples). Don't worry if you don't yet fully understand the source code. The main purpose of this example is to give you a feel for what a widget is, and which ones are available. The next examples give you a more gradual route to more advanced PyQt topics.
